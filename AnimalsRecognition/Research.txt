After modifing optimizer and learning rate there is a change in the accuracy and loss
model has shown improvement. CONCLUSION => large epochs will converge on the result
Done train data has been fit into 80% accuracy of 1000 images. train policy is now quite working but testing accuracy is not being improved
  loss oscillation POSSIBLE INFERENCE => Needed learning rate to be adjusted automatically
